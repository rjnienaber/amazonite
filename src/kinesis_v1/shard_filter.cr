    #
    # You can specify the following valid values:
    #
    # - `AFTER_SHARD_ID` - the response includes all the shards, starting with the shard whose ID
    # immediately follows the `ShardId` that you provided.
    #
    # - `AT_TRIM_HORIZON` - the response includes all the shards that were open at `TRIM_HORIZON`.
    #
    # - `FROM_TRIM_HORIZON` - (default), the response includes all the shards within the retention
    # period of the data stream (trim to tip).
    #
    # - `AT_LATEST` - the response includes only the currently open shards of the data stream.
    #
    # - `AT_TIMESTAMP` - the response includes all shards whose start timestamp is less than or equal
    # to the given timestamp and end timestamp is greater than or equal to the given timestamp or
    # still open.
    #
    # - `FROM_TIMESTAMP` - the response incldues all closed shards whose end timestamp is greater than
    # or equal to the given timestamp and also all open shards. Corrected to `TRIM_HORIZON` of the
    # data stream if `FROM_TIMESTAMP` is less than the `TRIM_HORIZON` value.
