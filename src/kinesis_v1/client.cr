    # Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are
    # continuously emitted from different data sources or *producers*. Scale-out within a stream is
    # explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in
    # a stream.
    #
    # You can create your data stream using either on-demand or provisioned capacity mode. Data
    # streams with an on-demand mode require no capacity planning and automatically scale to handle
    # gigabytes of write and read throughput per minute. With the on-demand mode, Kinesis Data Streams
    # automatically manages the shards in order to provide the necessary throughput.
    #
    # If you'd still like to proactively scale your on-demand data stream’s capacity, you can unlock
    # the warm throughput feature for on-demand data streams by enabling
    # `MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment` for your account. Once your account has
    # `MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment` enabled, you can specify the warm throughput in MiB per
    # second that your stream can support in writes.
    #
    # For the data streams with a provisioned mode, you must specify the number of shards for the data
    # stream. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data
    # read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up
    # to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or
    # decreases, you can add or remove shards.
    #
    # The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the Amazon Web Services account
    # used by the application. It is also scoped by Amazon Web Services Region. That is, two streams
    # in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in
    # two different Regions, can have the same name.
    #
    # `CreateStream` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a `CreateStream` request, Kinesis
    # Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to `CREATING`. After the stream is

    # returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that
    # contains records.
    #
    # You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for

    # Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the
    # *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*). Your application should have one thread per
    # shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call
    # GetRecords in a loop. Use GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to specify in the first
    # GetRecords call. GetRecords returns a new shard iterator in `NextShardIterator`. Specify the
    # shard iterator returned in `NextShardIterator` in subsequent calls to GetRecords. If the shard
    # has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and GetRecords returns `null` in
    # `NextShardIterator`. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard
    # iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the
    # last record to process.
    #
    # Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size by default. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports
    # large records up to 10 MiB in size, but the average throughput for your stream cannot exceed 1
    # MiB per second. For more information about how large records are handled, see [Large
    # records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/large-records.html). Each shard can read
    # up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size
    # or throughput by using the `Limit` parameter to specify the maximum number of records that
    # GetRecords can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The
    # maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000.
    #
    # The size of the data returned by GetRecords varies depending on the utilization of the shard. It
    # is recommended that consumer applications retrieve records via the `GetRecords` command using
    # the 5 TPS limit to remain caught up. Retrieving records less frequently can lead to consumer
    # applications falling behind. The maximum size of data that GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If a
    # call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw
    # `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the
    # stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw
    # `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. GetRecords doesn't return any data when it throws an
    # exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to GetRecords.
    # However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.
    #
    # To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the
    # `MillisBehindLatest` response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch
    # metrics and other mechanisms (see
    # [Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html) in the *Amazon

    # time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the
    # record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for
    # example with PutRecords). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees

    # A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records

    #
    # You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the `ShardIteratorType`
    # parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the
    # `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the
    # sequence number by using the `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator type, using sequence numbers
    # returned by earlier calls to PutRecord, PutRecords, GetRecords, or DescribeStream. In the
    # request, you can specify the shard iterator type `AT_TIMESTAMP` to read records from an
    # arbitrary point in time, `TRIM_HORIZON` to cause `ShardIterator` to point to the last untrimmed
    # record in the shard in the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or `LATEST` so that you
    # always read the most recent data in the shard.
    #
    # When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a GetShardIterator request to get the first shard
    # iterator for use in your first GetRecords request and for subsequent reads use the shard
    # iterator returned by the GetRecords request in `NextShardIterator`. A new shard iterator is

    # associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override
    # hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the
    # `ExplicitHashKey` parameter. For more information, see [Adding Data to a

    #
    # The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the
    # partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map
    # partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a

    #
    # Each record in the `Records` array may include an optional parameter, `ExplicitHashKey`, which

    # The `PutRecords` response includes an array of response `Records`. Each record in the response
    # array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the
    # top to the bottom of the request and response. The response `Records` array always includes the
    # same number of records as the request array.
    #
    # The response `Records` array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records.
    # Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each `PutRecords` request. A single
    # record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords
    # doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they
    # are written to the stream, use PutRecord instead of `PutRecords`, and write to the same shard.
    #
    # A successfully processed record includes `ShardId` and `SequenceNumber` values. The `ShardId`
    # parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The `SequenceNumber`
    # parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.
    #
    # An unsuccessfully processed record includes `ErrorCode` and `ErrorMessage` values. `ErrorCode`
    # reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values:
    # `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or `InternalFailure`. `ErrorMessage` provides more
    # detailed information about the `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` exception including the

    # Updating the shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data
    # Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to `UPDATING`. After the update is
    # complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to `ACTIVE`. Depending on the
    # size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to
    # read and write data to your stream while its status is `UPDATING`.
    #
    # To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual shards.
    # This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the final shards. These
    # short-lived shards count towards your total shard limit for your account in the Region.
    #
    # When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that is a multiple
    # of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify any target value within your shard limit. However,
    # if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling action might take longer to
    # complete.
    #
    # This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the following:
    #
    # - Scale more than ten times per rolling 24-hour period per stream
    #
    # - Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream
    #
    # - Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream
    #
    # - Scale up to more than 10000 shards in a stream
    #
    # - Scale a stream with more than 10000 shards down unless the result is less than 10000 shards
    #
    # - Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account
    #
    # - Make over 10 TPS. TPS over 10 will trigger the LimitExceededException
    #
