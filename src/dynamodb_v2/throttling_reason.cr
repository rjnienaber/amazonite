module Amazonite::DynamoDBV2
  # Represents the specific reason why a DynamoDB request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted
  # resource. This helps identify exactly what resource is being throttled, what type of operation
  # caused it, and why the throttling occurred.
  class ThrottlingReason
    include JSON::Serializable

    # The reason for throttling. The throttling reason follows a specific format:
    # `ResourceType+OperationType+LimitType`:
    #
    # - Resource Type (What is being throttled): Table or Index
    #
    # - Operation Type (What kind of operation): Read or Write
    #
    # - Limit Type (Why the throttling occurred):
    #
    # - `ProvisionedThroughputExceeded`: The request rate is exceeding the [provisioned throughput
    # capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/provisioned-capacity-mode.html)
    # (read or write capacity units) configured for a table or a global secondary index (GSI) in
    # provisioned capacity mode.
    #
    # - `AccountLimitExceeded`: The request rate has caused a table or global secondary index (GSI) in
    # on-demand mode to exceed the [per-table account-level service
    # quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ServiceQuotas.html#default-limits-throughput)
    # for read/write throughput in the current Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    # - `KeyRangeThroughputExceeded`: The request rate directed at a specific partition key value has
    # exceeded the [internal partition-level throughput
    # limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html),
    # indicating uneven access patterns across the table's or GSI's key space.
    #
    # - `MaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded`: The request rate has exceeded the [configured maximum
    # throughput
    # limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/on-demand-capacity-mode-max-throughput.html)
    # set for a table or index in on-demand capacity mode.
    #
    # Examples of complete throttling reasons:
    #
    # - TableReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded
    #
    # - IndexWriteAccountLimitExceeded
    #
    # This helps identify exactly what resource is being throttled, what type of operation caused it,
    # and why the throttling occurred.
