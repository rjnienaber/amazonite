    # The `BatchGetItem` operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more
    # tables. You identify requested items by primary key.
    #
    # A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items.
    # `BatchGetItem` returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's
    # provisioned throughput is exceeded, more than 1MB per partition is requested, or an internal
    # processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for
    # `UnprocessedKeys`. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to
    # get.
    #
    # If you request more than 100 items, `BatchGetItem` returns a `ValidationException` with the
    # message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."
    #
    # For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the
    # system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate
    # `UnprocessedKeys` value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application
    # can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset.
    #
    # If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the
    # tables in the request, then `BatchGetItem` returns a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.
    # If *at least one* of the items is successfully processed, then `BatchGetItem` completes
    # successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in `UnprocessedKeys`.
    #
    # If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items.
    # However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the
    # batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to
    # throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff,
    # the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.
    #
    # For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error
    # Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations)
    # in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    # By default, `BatchGetItem` performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request.
    # If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set `ConsistentRead` to `true` for any or
    # all tables.
    #
    # In order to minimize response latency, `BatchGetItem` may retrieve items in parallel.
    #
    # When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any
    # particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the
    # items in your request in the `ProjectionExpression` parameter.
    #
    # If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent
    # items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more

    # The `BatchWriteItem` operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single
    # call to `BatchWriteItem` can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network, consisting of up to
    # 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's
    # important to note that an item's representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in
    # DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see [Naming Rules
    # and Data
    # Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html).
    #
    # `BatchWriteItem` cannot update items. If you perform a `BatchWriteItem` operation on an existing
    # item, that item's values will be overwritten by the operation and it will appear like it was
    # updated. To update items, we recommend you use the `UpdateItem` action.
    #
    # The individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` operations specified in `BatchWriteItem` are atomic;
    # however `BatchWriteItem` as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's
    # provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed
    # operations are returned in the `UnprocessedItems` response parameter. You can investigate and
    # optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call `BatchWriteItem` in a loop. Each
    # iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new `BatchWriteItem` request with those
    # unprocessed items until all items have been processed.
    #
    # If `BatchWriteItem` cannot process any items due to throttling (for example, insufficient
    # provisioned throughput on the tables in the request, or partition-level or account-level
    # limits), it returns a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or a `ThrottlingException`. Both
    # indicate that the request was throttled; check the `ThrottlingReason` field in the returned
    # exception for details.
    #
    # If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items.
    # However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the
    # batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to
    # throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff,

    # in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    # With `BatchWriteItem`, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from
    # Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance
    # with these large-scale operations, `BatchWriteItem` does not behave in the same way as
    # individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on
    # individual put and delete requests, and `BatchWriteItem` does not return deleted items in the
    # response.
    #
    # If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items
    # in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With
    # languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a
    # time. In both situations, `BatchWriteItem` performs the specified put and delete operations in
    # parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce
    # complexity into your application.
    #
    # Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same
    # number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on
    # nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.
    #
    # If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:
    #
    # - One or more tables specified in the `BatchWriteItem` request does not exist.
    #
    # - Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the
    # corresponding table's primary key schema.
    #
    # - You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request.
    # For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request.
    #
    # - Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially
    # is two put operations).
    #
    # - There are more than 25 requests in the batch.
    #
    # - Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.
    #
    # - The total request size exceeds 16 MB.
    #
    # - Any individual items with keys exceeding the key length limits. For a partition key, the limit
    # is 2048 bytes and for a sort key, the limit is 1024 bytes.

    # Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your Amazon Web Services account in a
    # Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there.
    #
    # When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum
    # read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB
    # tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table
    # there. For more information, see [Service, Account, and Table
    # Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html) page in
    # the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    # Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at [Amazon Web Services Support
    # Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), obtaining the increase is not
    # instantaneous. The `DescribeLimits` action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are
    # currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply
    # for an increase before you hit a quota.
    #
    # For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the following:
    #
    # - Call `DescribeLimits` for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on
    # provisioned capacity there.
    #
    # - Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in
    # that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.
    #
    # - Call `ListTables` to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.
    #
    # - For each table name listed by `ListTables`, do the following:
    #
    # - Call `DescribeTable` with the table name.
    #
    # - Use the data returned by `DescribeTable` to add the read capacity units and write capacity
    # units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.
    #
    # - If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add
    # their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.
    #
    # - Report the account quotas for that Region returned by `DescribeLimits`, along with the total
    # current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.
    #
    # This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas.
    #
    # The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the
    # provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes.
    #
    # For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity
    # extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity
    # over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.
    #

    # The `Scan` operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a
    # table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a
    # `FilterExpression` operation.
    #
    # If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan
    # completes and results are returned to the user. The `LastEvaluatedKey` value is also returned
    # and the requestor can use the `LastEvaluatedKey` to continue the scan in a subsequent operation.
    # Each scan response also includes number of items that were scanned (ScannedCount) as part of the
    # request. If using a `FilterExpression`, a scan result can result in no items meeting the
    # criteria and the `Count` will result in zero. If you did not use a `FilterExpression` in the
    # scan request, then `Count` is the same as `ScannedCount`.
    #
    # `Count` and `ScannedCount` only return the count of items specific to a single scan request and,
    # unless the table is less than 1MB, do not represent the total number of items in the table.
    #
    # A single `Scan` operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the
    # `Limit` parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any filtering to the results if
    # a `FilterExpression` is provided. If `LastEvaluatedKey` is present in the response, pagination
    # is required to complete the full table scan. For more information, see [Paginating the
    # Results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.Pagination)
    # in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    # `Scan` operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or
    # secondary index, applications can request a parallel `Scan` operation by providing the `Segment`
    # and `TotalSegments` parameters. For more information, see [Parallel
    # Scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan)
    # in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    # By default, a `Scan` uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items in a table.
    # Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent `Scan` may not include the latest item
    # changes at the time the scan iterates through each item in the table. If you require a strongly
    # consistent read of each item as the scan iterates through the items in the table, you can set
    # the `ConsistentRead` parameter to true. Strong consistency only relates to the consistency of
    # the read at the item level.
    #
    # DynamoDB does not provide snapshot isolation for a scan operation when the `ConsistentRead`
    # parameter is set to true. Thus, a DynamoDB scan operation does not guarantee that all reads in a
    # scan see a consistent snapshot of the table when the scan operation was requested.
