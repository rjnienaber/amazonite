    #
    # - `application` – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn for a mobile app and device
    #
    # - `lambda` – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Lambda function
    #
    # - `firehose` – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream.
    property protocol : String

    # The endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary by protocol:
    #
    # - For the `http` protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with `http://`.
    #
    # - For the `https` protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with `https://`.
    #
    # - For the `email` protocol, the endpoint is an email address.
    #
    # - For the `email-json` protocol, the endpoint is an email address.
    #
    # - For the `sms` protocol, the endpoint is a phone number of an SMS-enabled device.
    #
    # - For the `sqs` protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS queue.
    #
    # - For the `application` protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a mobile app and device.
    #
    # - For the `lambda` protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Lambda function.
    #
    # - For the `firehose` protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon Data Firehose delivery
    # stream.
    property endpoint : String | Nil

    # A map of attributes with their corresponding values.
    #
    # The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that
    # the `Subscribe` action uses:
    #
    # - `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S
    # endpoints.
    #
    # - `FilterPolicy` – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive only a subset of
    # messages, rather than receiving every message published to the topic.
    #
    # - `FilterPolicyScope` – This attribute lets you choose the filtering scope by using one of the
    # following string value types:
    #
    # - `MessageAttributes` (default) – The filter is applied on the message attributes.
    #
    # - `MessageBody` – The filter is applied on the message body.
    #
    # - `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message delivery to Amazon SQS or
    # HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which
    # is otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.
    #
    # - `RedrivePolicy` – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the specified Amazon SQS
    # dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the
    # subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the service that powers
    # the subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further
    # analysis or reprocessing.
    #
    # The following attribute applies only to Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream subscriptions:
    #
    # - `SubscriptionRoleArn` – The ARN of the IAM role that has the following:
    #
    # - Permission to write to the Firehose delivery stream
    #
    # - Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity
    #
    # Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required for Firehose delivery stream
    # subscriptions. For more information, see [Fanout to Firehose delivery
    # streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-firehose-as-subscriber.html) in the
    # *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.
    #
    # The following attributes apply only to [FIFO
    # topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html):
    #
    # - `ReplayPolicy` – Adds or updates an inline policy document for a subscription to replay
    # messages stored in the specified Amazon SNS topic.
    #
    # - `ReplayStatus` – Retrieves the status of the subscription message replay, which can be one of
    # the following:
    #
    # - `Completed` – The replay has successfully redelivered all messages, and is now delivering
    # newly published messages. If an ending point was specified in the `ReplayPolicy` then the
    # subscription will no longer receive newly published messages.
    #
    # - `In progress` – The replay is currently replaying the selected messages.
    #
    # - `Failed` – The replay was unable to complete.
    #
    # - `Pending` – The default state while the replay initiates.
    property attributes : Hash(String, String) | Nil

    # Sets whether the response from the `Subscribe` request includes the subscription ARN, even if
    # the subscription is not yet confirmed.
    #
    # If you set this parameter to `true`, the response includes the ARN in all cases, even if the
    # subscription is not yet confirmed. In addition to the ARN for confirmed subscriptions, the
    # response also includes the `pending subscription` ARN value for subscriptions that aren't yet
    # confirmed. A subscription becomes confirmed when the subscriber calls the `ConfirmSubscription`
    # action with a confirmation token.
    #
    # The default value is `false`.
