  # Structure that contains the rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack
  # creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
  #
  # Rollback triggers enable you to have CloudFormation monitor the state of your application during
  # stack creation and updating, and to roll back that operation if the application breaches the
  # threshold of any of the alarms you've specified. For more information, see [Roll back your
  # CloudFormation stack on alarm breach with rollback
  # triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-rollback-triggers.html).
  class RollbackConfiguration
    # The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.
    #
    # By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to
    # any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify
    # rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously
    # specified for the stack. This means:
    #
    # - To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this
    # parameter.
    #
    # - To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want
    # used for this stack, even triggers you've specified before (for example, when creating the stack
    # or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of
    # triggers are no longer applied to the stack.
    #
    # - To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter.
    #
    # If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.
    property rollback_triggers : Array(RollbackTrigger) | Nil

    # The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback
    # triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.
    #
    # The default is 0 minutes.
    #
    # If you specify a monitoring period but don't specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still
    # waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You
    # can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually
    # cancel the stack creation or update (using
    # [CancelUpdateStack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html),
    # for example) as necessary.
    #
    # If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback
    # triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins
    # disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.
