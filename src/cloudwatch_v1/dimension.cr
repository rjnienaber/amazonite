  # A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions
  # are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one
  # of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2
  # metrics publish `InstanceId` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for
  # that dimension.
  #
  # You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.
