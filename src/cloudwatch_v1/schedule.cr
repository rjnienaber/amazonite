module Amazonite::CloudWatchV1
  # Specifies when and how long an alarm mute rule is active.
  #
  # The schedule uses either a cron expression for recurring mute windows or an at expression for
  # one-time mute windows. When the schedule activates, the mute rule mutes alarm actions for the
  # specified duration.
  class Schedule
    include JSON::Serializable

    # The schedule expression that defines when the mute rule activates. The expression must be
    # between 1 and 256 characters in length.
    #
    # You can use one of two expression formats:
    #
    # - **Cron expressions** - For recurring mute windows. Format: `cron(Minutes Hours Day-of-month
    # Month Day-of-week)`
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # - `cron(0 2 * * *)` - Activates daily at 2:00 AM
    #
    # - `cron(0 2 * * SUN)` - Activates every Sunday at 2:00 AM for weekly system maintenance
    #
    # - `cron(0 1 1 * *)` - Activates on the first day of each month at 1:00 AM for monthly database
    # maintenance
    #
    # - `cron(0 18 * * FRI)` - Activates every Friday at 6:00 PM
    #
    # - `cron(0 23 * * *)` - Activates every day at 11:00 PM during nightly backup operations
    #
    # The characters `*`, `-`, and `,` are supported in all fields. English names can be used for the
    # month (JAN-DEC) and day of week (SUN-SAT) fields.
    #
    # - **At expressions** - For one-time mute windows. Format: `at(yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm)`
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # - `at(2024-05-10T14:00)` - Activates once on May 10, 2024 at 2:00 PM during an active incident
    # response session
    #
    # - `at(2024-12-23T00:00)` - Activates once on December 23, 2024 at midnight during annual company
    # shutdown
    @[JSON::Field(key: "Expression")]
    property expression : String

    # The length of time that alarms remain muted when the schedule activates. The duration must be
    # between 1 and 50 characters in length.
    #
    # Specify the duration using ISO 8601 duration format with a minimum of 1 minute (`PT1M`) and
    # maximum of 15 days (`P15D`).
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # - `PT4H` - 4 hours for weekly system maintenance
    #
    # - `P2DT12H` - 2 days and 12 hours for weekend muting from Friday 6:00 PM to Monday 6:00 AM
    #
    # - `PT6H` - 6 hours for monthly database maintenance
    #
    # - `PT2H` - 2 hours for nightly backup operations
    #
    # - `P7D` - 7 days for annual company shutdown
    #
    # The duration begins when the schedule expression time is reached. For recurring schedules, the
    # duration applies to each occurrence.

    property duration : String

    # The time zone to use when evaluating the schedule expression. The time zone must be between 1
    # and 50 characters in length.
    #
    # Specify the time zone using standard timezone identifiers (for example, `America/New_York`,
    # `Europe/London`, or `Asia/Tokyo`).
    #
    # If you don't specify a time zone, UTC is used by default. The time zone affects how cron and at
    # expressions are interpreted, as well as start and expire dates you specify
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # - `America/New_York` - Eastern Time (US)
    #
    # - `America/Los_Angeles` - Pacific Time (US)
    #
    # - `Europe/London` - British Time
    #
    # - `Asia/Tokyo` - Japan Standard Time
    #
    # - `UTC` - Coordinated Universal Time
