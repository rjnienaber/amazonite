    #
    # If `InputTemplate` is a JSON object (surrounded by curly braces), the following restrictions
    # apply:
    #
    # - The placeholder cannot be used as an object key.

    # The following example shows the syntax for using `InputPathsMap` and `InputTemplate`.
    #
    # ` "InputTransformer":`
    #
    # `{`
    #
    # `"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},`
    #
    # `"InputTemplate": " is in state "`
    #
    # `}`
    #
    # To have the `InputTemplate` include quote marks within a JSON string, escape each quote marks
    # with a slash, as in the following example:
    #
    # ` "InputTransformer":`
    #
    # `{`
    #
    # `"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},`
    #
    # `"InputTemplate": " is in state \"\""`
    #
    # `}`
    #
    # The `InputTemplate` can also be valid JSON with varibles in quotes or out, as in the following
    # example:
    #
    # ` "InputTransformer":`
    #
    # `{`
    #
    # `"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},`
    #
    # `"InputTemplate": '{"myInstance": ,"myStatus": " is in state \"\""}'`
    #
