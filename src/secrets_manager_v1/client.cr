    # Creates a new secret. A *secret* can be a password, a set of credentials such as a user name and
    # password, an OAuth token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted form in
    # Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the connection information to access a database or
    # other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of
    # both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.
    #
    # For secrets that use *managed rotation*, you need to create the secret through the managing
    # service. For more information, see [Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services
    # services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html).
    #
    # For information about creating a secret in the console, see [Create a
    # secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html).
    #
    # To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the
    # `SecretString` parameter or the `SecretBinary` parameter, but not both. If you include
    # `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and
    # automatically attaches the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to it.
    #
    # For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the
    # secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the `SecretString` matches the [JSON structure
    # of a database
    # secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_secret_json_structure.html).
    #
    # If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed
    # key `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets
    # Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account
    # automatically have access to use `aws/secretsmanager`. Creating `aws/secretsmanager` can result
    # in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.
    #
    # If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the
    # API, then you can't use `aws/secretsmanager` to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use
    # a customer managed KMS key.
    #
    # Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include
    # sensitive information in request parameters except `SecretBinary` or `SecretString` because it
    # might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with
    # CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html).
    #
    # **Required permissions: ** `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`. If you include tags in the secret, you
    # also need `secretsmanager:TagResource`. To add replica Regions, you must also have
    # `secretsmanager:ReplicateSecretToRegions`. For more information, see [ IAM policy actions for
    # Secrets
    # Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions)
    # and [Authentication and access control in Secrets
    # Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html).
    #
    # To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than `aws/secretsmanager`, you need
    # `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permission to the key.
    #
    # When you enter commands in a command shell, there is a risk of the command history being

    #
    # We recommend you avoid calling `UpdateSecret` at a sustained rate of more than once every 10
    # minutes. When you call `UpdateSecret` to update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new
    # version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100,
    # but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you update the secret value
    # more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you
    # will reach the quota for secret versions.
    #
    # If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` to create a new secret version, Secrets Manager
    # automatically moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to the new version. Then it attaches the
    # label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.
    #
    # If you call this operation with a `ClientRequestToken` that matches an existing version's
    # `VersionId`, the operation results in an error. You can't modify an existing version, you can
    # only create a new version. To remove a version, remove all staging labels from it. See
    # UpdateSecretVersionStage.

    # `kms:Decrypt` permissions on the key. If you change the KMS key and you don't have `kms:Encrypt`
    # permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the
