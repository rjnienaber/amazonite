  # A destination for events that were processed successfully.
  #
  # To retain records of successful [asynchronous
  # invocations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-async-destinations),
  # you can configure an Amazon SNS topic, Amazon SQS queue, Lambda function, or Amazon EventBridge
  # event bus as the destination.
  #
  # `OnSuccess` is not supported in `CreateEventSourceMapping` or `UpdateEventSourceMapping`
  # requests.

    # The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination resource.
    #
    # Amazon SNS destinations have a message size limit of 256 KB. If the combined size of the
    # function request and response payload exceeds the limit, Lambda will drop the payload when
    # sending `OnFailure` event to the destination. For details on this behavior, refer to [Retaining
    # records of asynchronous
    # invocations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html).
