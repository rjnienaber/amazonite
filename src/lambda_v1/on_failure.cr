    # Amazon SNS destinations have a message size limit of 256 KB. If the combined size of the
    # function request and response payload exceeds the limit, Lambda will drop the payload when
    # sending `OnFailure` event to the destination. For details on this behavior, refer to [Retaining
    # records of asynchronous
    # invocations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html).
