  # Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance
  # types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the
  # referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture.
  #
  # Currently, only one instance family can be specified in the list.
  class PerformanceFactorReference
    # The instance family to use as a baseline reference.
    #
    # Ensure that you specify the correct value for the instance family. The instance family is
    # everything before the period (`.`) in the instance type name. For example, in the instance type
    # `c6i.large`, the instance family is `c6i`, not `c6`. For more information, see [Amazon EC2
    # instance type naming
    # conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-type-names.html) in
    # *Amazon EC2 Instance Types*.
    #
    # The following instance families are *not supported* for performance protection:
    #
    # - `c1`
    #
    # - `g3` | `g3s`
    #
    # - `hpc7g`
    #
    # - `m1` | `m2`
    #
    # - `mac1` | `mac2` | `mac2-m1ultra` | `mac2-m2` | `mac2-m2pro`
    #
    # - `p3dn` | `p4d` | `p5`
    #
    # - `t1`
    #
    # - `u-12tb1` | `u-18tb1` | `u-24tb1` | `u-3tb1` | `u-6tb1` | `u-9tb1` | `u7i-12tb` | `u7in-16tb`
    # | `u7in-24tb` | `u7in-32tb`
    #
    # If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned
    # instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families.
    #
    # If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API
    # returns an empty response for
    # [GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements)
    # and an exception for
    # [CreateFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFleet),
