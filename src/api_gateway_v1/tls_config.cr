    # Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the certificate for an integration
    # endpoint is issued by a supported certificate authority. This isn’t recommended, but it enables
    # you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities, or certificates that
    # are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which
    # includes checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root
    # certificate authority. Supported only for `HTTP` and `HTTP_PROXY` integrations.
    #
    # Enabling `insecureSkipVerification` isn't recommended, especially for integrations with public
    # HTTPS endpoints. If you enable `insecureSkipVerification`, you increase the risk of
    # man-in-the-middle attacks.
