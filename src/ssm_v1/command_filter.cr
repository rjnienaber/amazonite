module Amazonite::SsmV1
  # Describes a command filter.
  #
  # A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is `Pending` because the command
  # hasn't run on the node yet.
  class CommandFilter
    include JSON::Serializable

    # The name of the filter.
    #
    # The `ExecutionStage` filter can't be used with the `ListCommandInvocations` operation, only with
    # `ListCommands`.

    property key : CommandFilterKey

    # The filter value. Valid values for each filter key are as follows:
    #
    # - **InvokedAfter**: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify
    # `2024-07-07T00:00:00Z` to see a list of command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.
    #
    # - **InvokedBefore**: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify
    # `2024-07-07T00:00:00Z` to see a list of command executions from before July 7, 2021.
    #
    # - **Status**: Specify a valid command status to see a list of all command executions with that
    # status. The status choices depend on the API you call.
    #
    # The status values you can specify for `ListCommands` are:
    #
    # - `Pending`
    #
    # - `InProgress`
    #
    # - `Success`
    #
    # - `Cancelled`
    #
    # - `Failed`
    #
    # - `TimedOut` (this includes both Delivery and Execution time outs)
    #
    # - `AccessDenied`
    #
    # - `DeliveryTimedOut`
    #
    # - `ExecutionTimedOut`
    #
    # - `Incomplete`
    #
    # - `NoInstancesInTag`
    #
    # - `LimitExceeded`
    #
    # The status values you can specify for `ListCommandInvocations` are:
    #
    # - `Pending`
    #
    # - `InProgress`
    #
    # - `Delayed`
    #
    # - `Success`

    #
    # - `ExecutionTimedOut`
    #
    # - `Undeliverable`
    #
    # - `InvalidPlatform`
    #
    # - `Terminated`
    #
    # - **DocumentName**: Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM
    # document) for which you want to see command execution results. For example, specify
    # `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` to see command executions that used this SSM document to perform security
    # patching operations on managed nodes.
    #
    # - **ExecutionStage**: Specify one of the following values (`ListCommands` operations only):
    #
    # - `Executing`: Returns a list of command executions that are currently still running.
    #
    # - `Complete`: Returns a list of command executions that have already completed.
